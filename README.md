# Windows Setup Builder

This project is going to be a setup creater for my own moset used applications and programs. 
A much simplified version of this program does system installations through a website's API. In the initial trials phase of this project, exe files will be used by pulling them from a folder, in the later stages the program will continue to work with admin privileges by pulling the current versions over the internet. 
List of actively executable exe files:
- ChromeSetup.exe
- Docker Desktop Installer.exe
- Git-2.42.0.2.64.exe
- OfficeSetup.exe
- python-3.11.5-amd64.exe
- TeamsSetup_c_w_.exe
- vs_Professional.exe
- VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.81.1.exe
- winrar-x64-623tr.exe

Additionally one .msi file that can be executable
  - mongodb-windows-x86_64-7.0.1-signed.msi

 Be carefull, some programs needs setup choices and all the programm needs to be run as adminastor.
